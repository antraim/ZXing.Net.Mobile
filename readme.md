# ZXing.Net.Mobile
# This fork contains only ZXingSurfaceView for Xanarin.Android, ZXingScannerView for Xanarin.iOS and modified renderers of these views for Xamarin.Forms + ZXingBarcodeImageView. A lot of unnecessary garbage has been removed and classes have been refactored.

ZXing.Net.Mobile is a C#/.NET library based on the open source Barcode Library: [ZXing (Zebra Crossing)](https://github.com/zxing/zxing), using the [ZXing.Net Port](https://github.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net).  It works with Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.Forms.  The goal of ZXing.Net.Mobile is to make scanning barcodes as effortless and painless as possible in your own applications.

#### Xamarin Forms

For Xamarin Forms there is a bit more setup needed.  You will need to initialize the library on each platform in your platform specific app project.

##### Android 

On Android, in your main `Activity`'s `OnCreate (..)` implementation, call:

```csharp
Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.Init(Application);
ZXing.Net.Mobile.Forms.Android.Platform.Init();
```

ZXing.Net.Mobile for Xamarin.Forms also handles the new Android permission request model for you via Xamarin.Essentials, but you will need to add the following override implementation to your main `Activity` as well:

```csharp
public override void OnRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, string[] permissions, Permission[] grantResults)
{
    Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.OnRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    base.OnRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
}
```

##### iOS

In your `AppDelegate`'s `FinishedLaunching (..)` implementation, call:

```csharp
ZXing.Net.Mobile.Forms.iOS.Platform.Init();
```

### Features
- Xamarin.iOS
- Xamarin.Android
- Xamarin.Forms

### Barcode Formats
By default, all barcode formats are monitored while scanning.  You can change which formats to check for by passing a ZxingScanningOptions instance into the StartScanning method:

```csharp
var options = new ZXing.Mobile.MobileBarcodeScanningOptions();
options.PossibleFormats = new List<ZXing.BarcodeFormat>() { 
    ZXing.BarcodeFormat.Ean8, ZXing.BarcodeFormat.Ean13 
};
```

- Aztec
- Code 128
- Code 39
- Code 93
- EAN13
- EAN8
- PDF417
- QR
- UPC-E

### Thanks
